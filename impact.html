		   <p>"When my children are at school, I rely on free school meals to keep them well fed for the majority of the day. As a single mother of 2, it is a struggle once the holidays come around. That's where Hull Food Share comes in. The food shared by the students helps my family out a lot. I am able to keep the costs down so that I can provide for them in other ways. Thank you Hull Food Share!"</p>
