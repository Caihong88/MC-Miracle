        <p>"Thanks to food share, I have really seen the importance of not wasting food and helping people by sharing the food that I no longer need with others."</p>
						 <p>Andy</p>
		   <p>"Hull Food share greatly benefits people like me who have been living on the streets for many years. It isn't always easy to find my next meal but knowing that Hull Food Share are able to help puts my mind at ease."</p>

		   <p>"This service should be available to everyone who needs it. I have been living on my own since I was 16 years old, but times have been hard and I recently lost my job. At this moment in time I have been unable to get benefits. With that and still having to pay my rent and other bills food has had to be pushed further down on list of priorities. I am looking for a job but Hull Food Share is a great short-term solution for people like me."</p>

		   <p>"When my children are at school, I rely on free school meals to keep them well fed for the majority of the day. As a single mother of 2, it is a struggle once the holidays come around. That's where Hull Food Share comes in. The food shared by the students helps my family out a lot. I am able to keep the costs down so that I can provide for them in other ways. Thank you Hull Food Share!"</p>
