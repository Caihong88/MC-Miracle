  <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <div>
      <p>We are a group of students studying at the University of Hull, and our aim is to prevent left over food from going to waste.</p>
      <p>As students, it can be difficult to know what food to buy to stay healthy and save money. Our mission is to provide students with a platform where they can share food they don't want, or will be unable to consume before the use by date. Not only does this help to prevent food waste but it also helps students to save money by embracing a community spirit where everyone can benefit from sharing food among one another.</p>
      <p>How does this work? If you have food that you no longer want or don't think you'll be able to eat before it expires, upload a picture and drop it off at our collection point at Hull University. If you're in need of food or want to see what we have available, drop in and you can check out our collection of shared food.</p>
