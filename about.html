  <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <div>
      <p>We are a group of students studying at the University of Hull, and our aim is to prevent left over food from going to waste.</p>
      <p>As students, it can be difficult to know what food to buy to stay healthy and save money. Our mission is to allow students to share food they don't want, in order to save money and help cut down on food waste.</p>
      <p>How does this work? If you have food that you no longer want or don't think you'll be able to eat before it expires, upload a picture and drop it off at our collection point at Hull University. If you're in need of food or want to see what we have available, drop in and you can check out our collection of shared food.</p>
